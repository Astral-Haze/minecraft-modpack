//Currently very WIP
Minecraft modpack centered around GTCEU for 1.20.1
//I'm bad at names
Neoforge



## **Bugs to watch out for:**

### GTCEU
* veins cannot be weighted by or restricted to specific biomes, as far as I can tell, short of maybe using world gen layers with biome-specific blocks.

### Distant Horizons
* When certain mods (Including Supplementaries, Starlight) are present, lighting issues may occur during DH chunk creation
* Distant generation may cause crashes
* Clouds render over DH chunks, recomend disabling or raising clouds and/or increasing vanilla render distance to ensure cave ceilings render normally
