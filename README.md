# minecraft-modpack
//Currently very WIP
Minecraft modpack centered around GTCEU for 1.20.1
//I'm bad at names
Neoforge

**Bugs to watch out for:**

  GTCEU veins cannot be weighted by or restricted to specific biomes, as far as I can tell, short of maybe using world gen layers with biome-specific blocks.
